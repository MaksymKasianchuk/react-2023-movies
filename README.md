MovieLib
  This is a single page application (SPA) 🎥MovieLib where you can browse weekly popular movies and find something interesting to watch)
You can also view movie details, cast and reviews.
Also you can filter your movie search by search query, year of release, and include an adult rating in your search.
SPA if adaptive for mobile resolution. 

In development I used following libs and technologies:
  1. React, React-Router;
  2. formik, axios, yup, emotion;
  3. pixi.js, simplex-noise, debounce, hsl-to-hex.

 Project deployed to gh-pages, unfortunately SPA page "404 Not found" and params change in url string not working on gh-pages😒 But other stuff working correctly) 

Thank you for attention 😀
